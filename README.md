# Lab 1
## 1. Fork and clone

Before we begin, make sure to fork and clone this repository as we did yesterday:

  - Click the *Fork* button at the top right of the screen to make your own copy of the repository
  - Clone it as we did before:
  ```
  cd ~/Desktop
  git clone <YOUR-REPO-URL>
  cd y2s18-css2
  ```
## 2. Open the page

Open `lab1.html` in your browser. Take a look at it, before you make all your changes!

## 3. Style the header

- In `lab1_styles.css`, give the header class a bottom border of 1 point solid gray.
- Give it an all-around padding of 10px.
- Reload the page and see what happens!

## 4. Style the sidebar

- Give it a padding of 10px on the left and right, and 15px on the top and bottom.
### Reload the page
- Notice that the sidebar and main content are overlapping!
- **Fix this issue** by making the width of the sidebar smaller (see the slide on total width and height to adjust your calculations)

## 5. Style the main content
- Give it a 5 pixel wide, solid, red border.
- Give it margins of 5 pixels all around.
- Add padding on the left and right of 15 pixels, and on the bottom of 10 pixels.


## Extras!
### 1. Look up why there has to be `margin:0` for the body.
### 2. Give the title a box shadow.
### 3. Give the title text shadow.
### 4. Remove the underline from the links in the sidebar.
